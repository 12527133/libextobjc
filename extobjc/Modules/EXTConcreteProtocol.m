 *
 * For optimization reasons, though, we don't want to perform this work every
 * time a concrete protocol is encountered. What actually happens below is that
 * each concrete protocol is added to an array as it's loaded into memory, and
 * then, after all Objective-C runtime setup, the concrete protocols are
 * injected into any classes conforming to them. In this way, the brunt of the
 * work happens only once per application lifecycle.
