The ExtendedObjC library extends the dynamism of the Objective-C programming language to support additional patterns present in other dynamic programming languages (including those that are not necessarily object-oriented).

Current features include concrete protocols, safe categories, private methods, and conveniences for interacting with the runtime, among others.

This library is public domain, and can be incorporated for free and without attribution for any use.
